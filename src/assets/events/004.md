# ILU Nautilus // 13.12.503 CE
## --- INITIATING LOG ---
*"This is Dann Antares, acting operator of the Royal Lancer Corporation and captain of its ship-based headquarters, the RLC Nautilus."* The man talking lets out a small chuckle. *"Looks like this old dog is starting to remember its old tricks. And just in time too. This ragtag team of misfits has managed to somehow climb a rank in Atlas's internal ranking system. I'd say that's a good thing usually, but..."* His voice betrays a troubled mind. *"I expect we'll be getting more and more difficult contracts from now on, which is definitely not what I'd call optimal. I don't like risking their lives on the field for a few measly tokens. That being said, we may have bitten more than we can chew. Looks like the big dogs caught wind of our past escapades are positively chomping at the bit for a chance to throw us in the meat grinder. If that's what it takes to get some answer- Shit, I think the stupid bunny toy is fucking with Chips again. Gotta go."*
