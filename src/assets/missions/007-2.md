## Mission Title: Disappearing Act

This is a request from an anonymous client, who asks to remain as such until the contract has been accepted.

*"Hello everyone! Please, do not be alarmed by my modulated voice, this is all completely legit, I assure you! Now, I am in a bit of a situation and I'd like some... morally grey individuals to assist me with a small problem of mine. You see, I may or may have not ended up owing a LOT of credits to some rather unscrupulous individuals. Of course, these gentlemen are trying to collect, something I am not really fond of. As such, I have decided to do something bold! I need you to **assassinate** me. Interested? Accept the contract and I'll explain! Over and out!"*
