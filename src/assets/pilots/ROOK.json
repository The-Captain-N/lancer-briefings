Jovial and curious, Hachiko - her surname unknown - has a preference for brute, immediate action and uninhibited play. There are many personal details Hachiko claims not to remember, though she seems to come from Asteria-09. Hachiko has barcode tattoos scattered over her body, and her clothes are similarly branded with them as well. Even a handgun she proudly possesses is highly personalized. Hachiko claims no agency over her equipment and the frequent changes of her mech, often called Castle, and her friend. Hachiko is often accompanied by a heavily modified robot toy named BUN-E. Most unusually for a child, Hachiko is exceptionally proficient in both combat and piloting despite her clear lack of knowledge. Despite her often lethal lancing streaks, BUN-E censors any notion of death to Hachiko - direct exposure has proven to be extremely distressing and transformative, though Hachiko does not recall the incident. As of late, Hachiko's eyes have been enhanced and started to faintly glow, and she has an acute sense of immediate danger.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"Super Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"8a97a906-1d5e-42fb-be90-357ee436aa5b","name":"Flying Castle Requiem","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_sagarmatha","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue May 20 2025 00:22:45 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:88c19765-1c09-c308-2da4-9c582ade2a0e/mech/pic.png","loadouts":[{"id":"5beffc4b-d082-4e91-9b74-eb346abbf496","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_type_i_flight_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."},{"id":"ms_portable_bunker","uses":1,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"IPS-N’s “Portable Bunker” is actually a series of single-use expanding printer sheets: flat-pack pouches of inert non-Newtonian fluid that, when deployed, become a rigid structure capable of withstanding incredible force."}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":true,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":{"id":"mw_assault_cannon","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"IPS-N’s assault cannon of choice is a deep-cooled autocannon, fieldable as a mounted weapon or manipulator-operated platform.
